# recording each pack individually under root patterns is not great, but resolves these issues:
# - Using a /contrib/* or other glob in root_patterns is dodgy as runners & schemas are in the same dir.
#   In particular, with /contrib/* in root_patterns, *_runner imports become ambiguous
#   (eg `import noop_runner` should use runners/noop_runner/noop_runner not runners/noop_runner).
# - Using pack.yaml in marker_filenames prevents pants from inferring which fixture packs are
#   used by which tests. We import a PACK_NAME and PACK_PATH from fixture.py in each of these
#   fixture packs to enable this dependency inferrence. Having fine grained inferrence in-turn
#   reduces the number of tests that need to be re-run when we change a fixture.
# - Using another marker_file, like PACK_ROOT, is also problematic because of the core pack.
#   /contrib/core is symlinked to /st2tests/st2tests/fixtures/packs/core for use as a fixture.
#   It is used in quite a few tests, so it needs to continue living in both places.
#   But, overlapping source roots (for st2tests and the pack) make importing from the fixture
#   as we do with the other fixtures impossible.
# Thus, we really do need to register each pack in contrib (but never under st2tests) separately.
# We might also need to register packs in st2tests/testpacks.
